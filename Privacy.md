**Privacy Policy**

We built the OnePlayer app as a Freemium app. The Service is provided by us and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.

If you choose to use our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

We do not ask for personal or private information like names, email addresses, or payment information. Since we never have access to your personal information, we cannot and do not share it with third parties. 

We do not collect, store, process, use, or perform any other actions with the data generated during our Service in any server. All data related to our Service are stored on the user's device and in personal iCloud.

For users that do not purchase ad-removal features, advertisements provided by Google AdMob will be presented when using this app. To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps, including:

* IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
* Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
* User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.
* A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.
* Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.
* Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance.
