**Terms & Conditions**

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure that you read them carefully before using the app. 

**Your Commitments**
In return for our commitment to provide the OnePlayer App, we require you to make the below commitments to us. We want our App to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure, and in accordance with the law. So, we need you to commit to a few restrictions.

* You must not be prohibited from receiving any aspect of our OnePlayer App under applicable laws or engaging in payments related app if you are on an applicable denied party listing.
* You cannot do anything unlawful, misleading, or fraudulent or for an illegal or unauthorized purpose.
* You cannot do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the OnePlayer App.
* You agree that we can install updates to the Sex Keeper App on your device.
* You agree not to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. 
* You agree not to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. 

**The Data Policy**
We do not collect, store, process, use, or perform any other actions with the personal data of our users that are specified in the application. All information and data are stored on the client's device. The Privacy Policy explains how we use information. We do, however, use Google AdMob to demonstrate advertisements to users that does not purchase advanced features. To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps.

**"In-app" Purchases**
The App may include "in-app" purchases that allow you to use advanced features, such as removing ads, and unlimited number of playlists. If it does, it will not be necessary to make any "in-app" purchases in order to use the basic functions. Payments will be processed through the iTunes app store from which you originally downloaded the application. You may access the applicable "in-app" purchase rules and policies directly from the app store.

Whilst you cannot switch off "in-app" purchases from being offered to you within the app, you can switch off/manage your ability to complete "in-app" purchases by altering the settings on the device you use for this app. You acknowledge that and agree that you are fully responsible for managing your "in-app" purchases.

If you are under 18 then you must have your parents' or guardians' permission to make any "in-app" purchases. By completing an "in-app" purchase, you are confirming to us that you have any and all permission that may be necessary in order to allow you to make that "in-app" purchase.

**Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree**
If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect. Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of this agreement, it will not be a waiver. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.

**Who Has Rights Under this Agreement**
This agreement does not give rights to any third parties. You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent. Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.

**Who Is Responsible if Something Happens**
Our OnePlayer App is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the time. To the extent permitted by law, we also disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We also don't control what people and others do or say, and we aren't responsible for their (or your) actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or content (including unlawful or objectionable content). We also aren't responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our app. Our responsibility for anything that happens on the app (also called "liability") is limited as much as the law will allow. If there is an issue with our app, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that we won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know they are possible. This includes when we delete your content or information.

**Unsolicited Material**
We always appreciate feedback or other suggestions, but may use them without any restrictions or obligation to compensate you for them, and are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
